# Kettle-updater
Just an exe that updates the files inside a raspberry pico to the current version by pasting a github link.

Download the executable verison zipped on the Releases section.
Please get the updater out of the zip file and then run the .exe with the "_internals" in the same folder :)

The code that runs can be viewed and is open source.
